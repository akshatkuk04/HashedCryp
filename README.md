# HashedCryp - A Differential Cryptanalysis attack on a Toy Cipher

This project implements a differential cryptanalysis attack on the toy cipher described in *[A Tutorial on Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf)* by Howard M. Heys.

## Features
- Operates on the S-box defined in the tutorial.
- Takes an input key.
- Generates a differential characteristic.
- Outputs the last-round key based on filtering probability.
